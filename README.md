# LearnJjBranching

## About this project

This project is a fork of [LearnGitBranching](https://github.com/pcottle/learnGitBranching), adapted for learning [Jujutsu (jj)](https://github.com/martinvonz/jj).

Most of the modifications were done by an LLM. It serves as an experimental project to explore AI-assisted learning of new version control tools. I made it for my own jj learning journey, and if it helps you too, that's great!

PRs are highly welcome, including those generated by LLMs - whether it's fixing bugs, improving translations, or adding new levels.

LearnJjBranching is a jj (Jujutsu) repository visualizer, sandbox, and a series of educational tutorials and challenges. Its primary purpose is to help developers understand jj through the power of visualization. This is achieved through a game with different levels to get acquainted with the different jj commands.

Based on the excellent [LearnGitBranching](https://github.com/pcottle/learnGitBranching) project by Peter Cottle.

You can input a variety of commands into LearnJjBranching -- as commands are processed, the nearby commit tree will dynamically update to reflect the effects of each command.

### Sandbox Mode

By default the application launches in "sandbox mode" with a basic repository already created. Here you can enter commands and mess around with a repository as much as you like. Keep in mind you can

* `undo` to undo the effects of the last command
* `reset` to start over with a clean slate (works in levels too)

## Levels

Type `levels` to see the available lessons / challenges (and which ones you have solved so far). Each level series aims to teach some high-level jj concept.

## Building yourself / Contributing

```bash
git clone <your fork of the repo>
cd learnJjBranching
yarn install

yarn gulp fastBuild # skips tests and linting, faster build

# after building you can open up your browser to the index.html
open ./index.html
```
